I suppose I will inaugurate the blog for 2007. Here’s a link to an interesting blog post by Mark Cuban on why he doesn’t wear suits.

Personally I used to really dislike wearing suits, but now I find them to be tolerable. Perhaps we should adopt a compromise solution…dispose of “business formal” attire and only require “business casual” attire.

This reminds me of my experience at Globecom 2004 in Dallas, where I saw one presenter give a talk wearing a hooded sweatshirt, jeans and sneakers.
