Chan-Byoung made a good post on this topic a while back, and I think we should have some discussion of this based on this guide that I’ve started reading recently.

One of my initial observations is that each student should assume most of the responsibility of “being a good graduate student,” but that the advisor should help the student to some extent in this regard. If I had been proactive enough to look for these online guides two (or even four) years ago, hmmm…

Robert, do you have any thoughts on this?
